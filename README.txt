INTRODUCTION
------------

this is our own shell, we had to recreate bash and had to code our own builtins

the project showed us how to implement pipes, redirections, heredoc, environment variables and much more

we added wildcards as a bonus


UTILISATION
------------

(install readline if you don't have it yet)

run 'make'

run './minishell' to enter the shell

enter any unix commands
